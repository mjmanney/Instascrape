# Instascrape

Search Instagrams public (but hidden) endpoints for media.
This does not require the developer to use an API. 

The search will yield the most recent posts.
Currently it is unable to load more of the same search result, 
however it is possible to search and load images from different 
terms. 

Searching to often may result in Instagram temporarily blocking
the request through rate limiting.
